# Pooling_Methods

Models for optimizing the use of scarce resources such as lab tests for COVID-19.
We are including a dataset address and a pooling algorithm for grouping lab tests. 
Our algorithm was tested with simulated data and with a real dataset from a 
Brazilian hospital that contains labeled instances of individuals that checked in 
at the hospital suspecting with COVID-19.
